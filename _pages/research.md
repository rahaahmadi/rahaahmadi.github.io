## Research Assistant at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/)

- Collaborated in implementing an image super-resolution network using transformers with hierarchical and spectral feature attention to restore high-quality images from low-quality images.
- Under the Supervision of [Dr. Alireza Esmaeilzehi](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=WAISKYYAAAAJ&hl=en)

*April 2023 – Now*

## Research Assistant at [IPM Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences](http://www.ipm.ac.ir/)

- Proposed a novel approach that encourages the model to focus on the primary object of the image and mitigates biases in image classification. This approach leads to an improvement in classification accuracy, reduced sensitivity to background noise, and enhanced model interpretability. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01473.pdf)

*June 2022 – June 2023*

## Research Assistant at [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/), NLP Lab

- Knowledge Graph
    - Extracted data from Wikipedia pages into a graph format using Neo4j.
    - Implemented a question-answering system using NLP techniques such as named entity recognition and entity linking, enabling users to retrieve answers to questions from the knowledge graph.
- Named Entity Recognition
    - Designed a Persian Named Entity Recognition System using transformer-based language models tuned with different classifiers.
    - Enhanced model performance in the detection of rare entities using few-shot learning techniques.
- Under the Supervision of  [Saeedeh Momtazi](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=N-WqXykAAAAJ&hl=en)
